        							During the summer prior to the 2018-2019 school year, I built a new website for Carnegie Mellon Quiz Bowl, an organization that plays and hosts academic knowledge competitions. I used the materialize React framework to streamline the development process, which only took about 28 hours total. Before this, I never used HTML, CSS, JS, or React before; By developing the website and heavily modifying the react framework, I learned all of these skills on-the fly, while producing a presentable product in  a relatively short amount of time.

    								During my senior year of high school, I engaged in a massive foray into Machine Learning and Digital Signal Processing for the Capital Area Science and Engineering Fair in Harrisburg, PA, where I finished 2nd in my category. My goal was to determine what a human subject was doing using their electroencephalogram (EEG) signals out of 4 classes. I built my own EEG headset using mostly common hardware and a 3D printer. From there, I gleaned features out of the EEG signals throguh Signal Processing and feature analysis. I also implemented several Bayesian Machine Learning algorithms to do the actual classification. Here's my abstract: <br><br>

											A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) using electroencephalography (EEG) shows promise as a user interface for computers. One of the main areas of this research focuses on associating EEG data with certain mental processes such as reﬂective listening, relaxation, and problem solving. This project’s research seeks to collect EEG data from human participants while they are performing three diﬀerent tasks for the testing and training of two Bayesian classiﬁcation algorithms whose purpose is to recognize the distinction in EEG data among the three processes. The research hypothesis is that the Bayesian Network approach with structure learning will be more accurate with a small data set than the standard Naive Bayes. An eﬀective BCI could have widespread medical implications. One such example is allowing for those with High Functioning Autism Spectrum disorders to monitor their own biofeedback, thereby detecting trigger behaviors before they occur by analyzing speciﬁc biofeedback markers provided by real time EEG data.

It was an electric generator that drew enough power from the small, choppy waves of Lake Wallenpaupack to light the docks at night. I designed and built most of the electronic systems, designing the PCB and programming the PIC microcontroller present on the board.

        							In 2018, my team attempted, and almost succeeded in implementing Tic-Tac-Toe with <em>only discrete components</em>. More specifically, we only used transistors, resistors, diodes, and switches in our device. We spent late fall designing and optimizing our circuit from a finite state model, down to boolean expressions, finally using device behavior to cut as many components as we could. During build week, we spent several days mass-producing logic gates and multiplexers, and after unit testing all of the components, we just ran out of time when putting it all together. We learned a lot about how important time management and specific planning is, and subsequently we are already planning for 2019.
